## Maven Market Project

For this project, I used Power BI to clean, analyze and visualize a data set from Maven Analytics called Maven Market. Maven Market is a business which owns a variety of grocery stores of differing sizes across multiple countries including the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In this dashboard analysis, I will review the insights I gained while creating the report. This project was a bonus project from the Power BI Desktop For Business Intelligence Course from Maven Analytics.

## Dataset

The raw data came in the from of CSV files which were then brought into Power BI using Get Data. The data was then transformed and cleaned into a more workable set. This process was repeated for each table/CSV file.

The cleaning process for this dataset was fairly straightforward requiring mainly header promotion, data type corrections and creation of additional columns that made working with the dataset easier later on. Additionally, the raw dataset provided 2 tables for transactions, one for each year (1997 and 1998). As both of these tables had the same table and column structure, they were appended into one table titled “Transactions Data” containing both years. I then conducted data verification and ensured that the new table contained the correct number of rows and columns.
